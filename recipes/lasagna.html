    this is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
    made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
    traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my
    mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
    I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
    crusty garlic bread.

      1. Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and
      crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir
      in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5
      teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
    </li>

      2. Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water
      until they're al dente.
    </li>

      3. Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the
      remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
      4. Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe
      (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is
      assembled.
    </li>
    <li>
      5. Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for
      about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is
      golden brown.
